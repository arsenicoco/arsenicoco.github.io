        <p>I know I wasn’t posting for some time. This year I will change this. Nicole is growing like crazy and is already 1 year and 5 months old. And I’ve been really focusing on her. And also on work. Or rather how work evolved around me. </p>
<p>The good thing - I broke <strong>200</strong> <a href="http://rocyclestudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocycle</a> rides after a little more than a year of rides. This is something that gives me necessary few hours a week of inward focus, letting the mind roam around, and of course feeling healthy and fit. Honestly, don’t know what it would have been without it.</p>
<h2 id="Resolutions"><a href="#Resolutions" class="headerlink" title="Resolutions"></a>Resolutions</h2><p>I have to make a few resolutions for the remainder of 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write more. Both to Twitter and the blog.</li>
<li>Journal things for myself. Hopefully every night.</li>
<li>Meditate more. Every morning at least.</li>
<li>Workout more and eat healthy - at least to break 90 kg of weight down - now at 93 kg. </li>
<li>Work more. As in, produce more meaningfful stuff.</li>
<li>Read daily. At least a chapter a day - most likely by cutting down on social media.</li>
<li>Learn a new skill every month. Starting from today.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="New-me"><a href="#New-me" class="headerlink" title="New me"></a>New me</h3><p>I will strive to change internally, and then project that change in the way I work and in the way I behave. I do beliebe that those things are deeply connected. You can imagine yourself in the following three concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>why</li>
<li>how</li>
<li>what</li>
<li>outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>However you act is supposedly defined by your personality and it defines the outcomes of actions. But I beliebe that as humans we can influence the outcomes not only by doing things, but also change why we’re doing things by doing them mindfully. </p>
<p>So, I’ll focus on my own mindfulness more, and make sure that whatever I do, I reflect upon and I find inspiration for next actions in every single of my actions.</p>
<h3 id="Downsize"><a href="#Downsize" class="headerlink" title="Downsize"></a>Downsize</h3><p>I will continuously reduce the number of:</p>
<ul>
<li>pieces of clothes I own;</li>
<li>people I follow on Instagram, making it a real connection tool for friends since leaving Facebook;</li>
<li>notifications I receive on  the phone;</li>
<li>emails I receive on my accounts;</li>
<li>people I worry about;</li>
<li>TV shows I watch - let’s say that anything below 8 on IMDB or a recommendation from a very good critic will be avoided.</li>
</ul>
